As a developer, the main software I install on my PC is my code editor. As if it is the only code editor available, the number one choice for almost all developers is vs code. It is a really good code editor which contains all features a developer needs.  

If you feel like you need extra features you can use the large ecosystem of extensions.

When I set up VS Code for my day-to-day coding I install a couple of extensions. Here are some of these extensions and their uses;

- vs-code icons (with “Material Icon Theme” installed as a theme for the icons library)
- Auto Rename Tag
- [ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native Snippets]([https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/the-best-react-extension-for-vs-code](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/the-best-react-extension-for-vs-code))
- Live Server(Extension Id: ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- Ruby(semantic highlighting and formatting support)

## Keyboard shortcuts

To increase productivity many developers use keyboard shortcuts. To change the default keyboard shortcuts of vs code go to File > Preferences > Keyboard shortcuts and search for the command you want to modify. Here is the list of the keyboard shortcuts I **modify** after installing vs-code. 

| Keyboard shortcut  | Command | purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ctrl + D | Copy Line Below | Duplicate a line of code below  |
