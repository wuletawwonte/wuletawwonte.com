# Rails debugging

## debug method

When working on a rails project you may need the values of variables for debugging purposes. There are a lot of rails gems that can help you with debugging. But Rails is made to help you in all aspects of your code development demands. It has got a built-in method called `debug` which you can use to debug your code. You can check the values of variables that you are not quite sure of in the front end by just printing out the value of the debug method and passing the variable as an argument. 

## console in the front end

You can also write `<%= console %>` in your `erb` and see the rails console in your browser. You can debug your app in the browser just like you do in the rails console.
